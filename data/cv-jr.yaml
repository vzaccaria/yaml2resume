    summary: "I leverage my love of learning and mastery of computer engineering to transform ideas to products. In my industrial and academic experience I discovered that team coordination and leadership are at least as important as technical competence for a successful project outcome. I feel that these abilities have become natural to me and that is why I want to step up to the next level."

  work:
    -
      position: "Assistant Professor"
      startDate: '2009-01-01'
      company: "Politecnico di Milano"
      address: "Milan, Italy"
      highlights:
        - "Developed support tools for web development such as \\textsc{webmake} (a tool for managing builds of front-end/back-end systems in Javascript) and \\textsc{fluent-fsm} for easily specifying finite state machines in web applications."

      position: "Research and Development Engineer"
      company: "STMicroelectronics"
      address: "Lugano, Switzerland"
      highlights:
        - "Specified, prototyped and validated several ST200 processor architectural extensions. Vertical validation of the extensions from the ISA up to the application-layer/OS."
        - "Enabled secure co-hosting of more operating systems by means of secure storage extensions of the ST200 architecture."
        - "Collaborated to the specification, validation (by means of functional and timing simulation) and architectural exploration for symmetric multi-processing based on ST200."
        - "Architectural specification and design of multi-threaded architectures based on stream-programming paradigms."
