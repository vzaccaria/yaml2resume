  statement: "I leverage my love of learning and mastery of computer engineering to transform ideas to products. In my industrial and academic experience I discovered that team coordination and leadership are at least as important as technical competence for a successful project outcome. I feel that these abilities have become natural to me and that is why I want to step up to the next level."
